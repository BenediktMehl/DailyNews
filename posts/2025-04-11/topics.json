        "content": "\u2190 Rakhim's blog But what if I really want a faster horse? 4 April 2025 People in tech business circles love this quote by Henry Ford: If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses. The idea is to think outside the box and create entirely new markets instead of just new products in existing ones. Like Apple creating the iPhone (sure, smartphones existed before\u2014but cars also existed before the Ford Model T). But sometimes, I really want a faster horse. Netflix in 2012 was a super fast horse. It had a simple but massive catalog of movies and shows, solid recommendations, and basic library management. Compared to my limited local media library it was great. You could actively tune your tastes and rate things with a 5-star system. Netflix today is very different. It\u2019s not a library\u2014it\u2019s an experience. Instead of reliably showing me what I \"have\" and recommending what I might like, it shuffles content on each interaction, sometimes changing the cover images of shows in real time, like some black-market charlatan. It has no meaningful catalog, no real categories\u2014just short-lived, auto-generated groups like \u201cBinge-worthy\u201d or \u201cFestive spirit.\u201d Even the \u201cNew\u201d section is meaningless. It opens with a \u201cFor You\u201d row (huh?), then \u201cContinue Watching\u201d, followed by generic \"Popular in \" rows. It feels like YouTube search: ask for something specific, get a few hits, and then a flood of unrelated \"popular\" and \"recommended\" content. \u201cMy List\u201d on Netflix randomly shuffles items and changes their covers every few hours. \u201cContinue Watching\u201d may or may not include what I actually watched recently. Sometimes, the engagement algorithms resurrect some random Slovakian cartoon I opened three years ago\u2014one and immediately closed because it that had no English subtitles here in Finland, even though they do exist in other regions. I just want a faster horse. Spotify in 2015 was also a super fast horse. It was like my iTunes library, but with millions more tracks. Getting new music became faster, but it didn\u2019t change the nature of my relationship with music. Spotify today is... basically Netflix. An inconsistent stream of ever-changing content, weak library tools, and an endless barrage of podcasts. Overall, consistency, user control, and actual UX innovation are in decline. Everything is converging on TikTok\u2014which is basically TV with infinite channels. You don\u2019t control anything except the channel switch. It's like Carcinisation, a form of convergent evolution where unrelated crustaceans all evolve into something vaguely crab-shaped. The list goes on: YouTube. YouTube: Once a video catalog with social discovery. Now? TikTok. LinkedIn. Once a network of resumes. Now? TikTok. Substack. Yeah, a newsletter platform... now launching TikTok-style videos.

Founded in 2018, Nate raised over $50 million from investors like Coatue and Forerunner Ventures, most recently raising a $38 million Series A in 2021 led by Renegade Partners. Nate said its app\u2019s users could buy from any e-commerce site with a single click, thanks to AI. In reality, however, Nate relied heavily on hundreds of human contractors in a call center in the Philippines to manually complete those purchases, the DOJ\u2019s Southern District of New York alleges. Saniger raised millions in venture funding by claiming that Nate was able to transact online \u201cwithout human intervention,\u201d except for edge cases where the AI failed to complete a transaction. But despite Nate acquiring some AI technology and hiring data scientists, its app\u2019s actual automation rate was effectively 0%, the DOJ claims. Nate\u2019s heavy usage of human contractors was the subject of an investigation by The Information in 2022. Saniger didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. He is currently listed as a managing partner at New York VC Buttercore Partners, which didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment either. The DOJ\u2019s indictment says that Nate ran out of money and was forced to sell its assets in January 2023, leaving its investors with \u201cnear total\u201d losses. Albert Saniger\u2019s LinkedIn profile indicates he was no longer CEO as of 2023. Nate isn\u2019t the only startup that has allegedly exaggerated its AI capabilities. For example, an \u201cAI\u201d drive-through software startup was also powered largely by humans in the Philippines, The Verge reported in 2023. More recently, Business Insider reported that an AI legal tech unicorn, EvenUp, used humans to do much of its work.

Default styles for h1 elements are changing Simon Pieters April 11, 2025 4 minute read Browsers are starting to roll out changes in default UA styles for nested section headings. Developers should check that their sites don't rely on UA styles for certain cases to avoid unexpected results and failing Lighthouse checks. In this post, we'll have a look at what the incoming changes are, how to identify if it's an issue on your pages, and some hints for conformant and better-structured websites. What's changing The HTML spec used to define an outline algorithm that gave <h1> elements an implicit semantic heading level based on how many sectioning elements (<section>, <aside>, <nav>, and <article>) it was nested inside. The browser rendering was such that section > h1 would have the same font-size and margin as <h2>. The section > section > h1 would be represented as <h3>, and so on. The default rendering was implemented in browsers in their UA styles, but not the heading level in the accessibility tree (what screen readers use). Websites started to use sectioning elements, but didn't expect to see the automatic heading levels from the outline algorithm. In general, this created confusion about where developers could use <h1> elements, tools handled the HTML differently, and the outline algorithm was considered problematic. The outline algorithm was removed from the HTML spec in 2022, but the UA stylesheet rules still remain. The rules in the default styles are what browser vendors are starting to remove now. CSS Copy to Clipboard /* where x is :is(article, aside, nav, section) */ x h1 { margin-block: 0.83em; font-size: 1.50em; } x x h1 { margin-block: 1.00em; font-size: 1.17em; } x x x h1 { margin-block: 1.33em; font-size: 1.00em; } x x x x h1 { margin-block: 1.67em; font-size: 0.83em; } x x x x x h1 { margin-block: 2.33em; font-size: 0.67em; } For example: HTML Copy to Clipboard Play <body> <h1>Level 1</h1> <section> <h1>Level 2</h1> <section> <h1>Level 3</h1> <section> <h1>Level 4</h1> </section> </section> </section> </body> This looks as follows in the old UA styles: The new UA styles will have this appearance: And here's the HTML example above with your browser's default styles: Play What to expect and when Alongside the changes in browser styles, page auditing tools like Lighthouse now flag cases of <h1>s without defined font-size as bad practice. Here's the gist of what to expect: <h1> will no longer adapt its style based on surrounding sectioning elements like <section>, <article>, <nav>, and <aside>. UA stylesheet will apply the same style to <h1> with no implicit styles that demote <h1> to match <h2>, <h3>, etc. Lighthouse will flag a warning if <h1> is used without a specified font-size. The Lighthouse deprecation warning to look out for is H1UserAgentFontSizeInSection. Hints for dealing with this are described in the next section. In terms of when this is happening, changes are rolling out in the following browsers in this timeline: Firefox From March 31, 2025, Firefox is rolling out changes to 50% of Beta 138 users to remove UA styles for h1 in article, aside, nav, or section on desktop. The plan is to roll out to 5% of users on the Firefox 138 stable release, ramp up to 50% of users, then ship on all platforms in Firefox 140. bug 1885509. Since Firefox 136, developers will see a console warning for h1s in article/aside/nav/section without author-defined font-size or margins: bug 1937568. To test in Firefox with the new behavior, set layout.css.h1-in-section-ua-styles.enabled to false in about:config. Chrome Since version 136, Chrome shows deprecation warnings for <h1> inside the 4 elements, when the <h1> uses the default smaller font size. Marking something deprecated in Chromium will lower Lighthouse scores for \"Best Practices\": issue 394111284 Safari There's no implementation bugs to track in Safari for these changes yet, but we can expect WebKit to follow with equivalent updates. Fixing the Lighthouse warning Lighthouse has recently inherited a check based on Chromium's DevTools warnings for sites that don't specify a font-size for <h1> elements. The new rule is called H1UserAgentFontSizeInSection and shows up since March following the addition of deprecation warnings. If you see the <h1> warning, make sure you're applying an explicit <h1> font-size and margins. Here's some recommended styles to use: CSS Copy to Clipboard h1 { margin-block: 0.67em; font-size: 2em; } To avoid overwriting other style rules that target <h1> you can use :where(), which has zero specificity: CSS Copy to Clipboard :where(h1) { margin-block: 0.67em; font-size: 2em; } The MDN page for heading elements now contains the usage notes listed above so there is a visible place for developers to see this information. Summary Here's some things to keep in mind: Do not rely on default browser styles for conveying a heading hierarchy. Explicitly define your document hierarchy using <h2> for second-level headings, <h3> for third-level, etc. Always define your own font-size and margin for <h1> elements. Consider updating your CSS resets to account for the change. Audit your site using Lighthouse and browser DevTools to check for deprecated usage. Check the usage notes on the MDN documentation for HTML section headings.
