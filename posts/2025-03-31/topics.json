        "content": "Music Performance Art Research Archive Random Contact The demoscene as a UNESCO heritage in Sweden Mar 31, 2025 | ramblings The demoscene has become a national UNESCO-heritage in Sweden, thanks to an application that Ziphoid and me did last year. This has already happened in several European countries, as part of the international Art of Coding initiative to make the demoscene a global UNESCO heritage. I think this makes plenty of sense, since the demoscene is arguably the oldest creative digital subculture around. It has largely stuck to its own values and traditions throughout the world\u2019s technological and economical shifts, and that sort of consistency is quite unusual in the digital world. The main idea of the demoscene is to compete with productions that maximize a certain hardware, but that\u2019s not what all demosceners like to do. My demogroup Hack n\u2019 Trade for example, cares more about making weird stuff, and there are plenty of other groups like that. Some demosceners don\u2019t release anything at all, but might do important work to keep the scene alive (BBS-trading, organizing parties, preserving software\u2026). I\u2019ve written plenty of papers and blog posts about the demoscene, and I\u2019ve often felt a gap between the stuff I write as a researcher and my personal experience of the demoscene. There is certainly an international demoscene with big events and huge releases that can be described in general terms, but what has mattered more to me is the local scenes, the small parties and the people you hang out with. Meeting up with a bunch of friends and making weird computer stuff \u201cfor no reason, really\u201d is a great setting. That\u2019s what I enjoy the most, in the end. For other sceners, it\u2019s different. There is a sort of diversity in the scene that is difficult to capture and generalize. The Swedish coder with a well-paid programming job and a busy family life might consider the demoscene as an escape to his teenage years, while the LSD-munching raver from France who trades illegal warez on BBSs and makes weird pixel art considers the scene as a free culture without corporate or art world bullshit. There\u2019s room for both in the scene, because it is werdly conservative and open at the same time. And perhaps that is one of the reasons why it should be considered an intangible heritage.",

But I mostly care about how the model compares against the best available coding model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet (thinking), released at the end of February, which I have been using, and it has been a great experience. Let\u2019s compare these two coding models and see if I need to change my favourite coding model or if Claude 3.7 still holds. TL;DR If you want to jump straight to the conclusion, I\u2019d say go for Gemini 2.5 Pro, it\u2019s better at coding, has one million in context window as compared to Claude\u2019s 200k, and you can get it for free (a big plus). However, Claude\u2019s 3.7 Sonnet is not that far behind. Though at this point there\u2019s no point using it over Gemini 2.5 Pro. Just an article ago, Claude 3.7 Sonnet was the default answer to every model comparison, and this remained the same for quite some time. But here you go, Gemini 2.5 Pro takes the lead. Brief on Gemini 2.5 Pro Gemini 2.5 Pro, an experimental thinking model, became the talk of the town within a week of its release. Everyone\u2019s talking about this model on Twitter (X) and YouTube. It\u2019s trending everywhere, like seriously. The first model from Google to receive such fanfare. And it is #1 in the LMArena just like that. But what does this mean? It means that this model is killing all the other models in coding, math, Science, Image understanding, and other areas. Gemini 2.5 pro comes with a 1 million token context window, with a 2 million context window coming soon. \ud83e\udd2f You can check out other folks like Theo-t3 talking about this model to get a bit more insight into it: It is the best coding model to date, with an accuracy of about 63.8% on the SWE bench. This is definitely higher than our previous top coding model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which had an accuracy of about 62.3%. This is a quick demo Google shared on this model of building a dinosaur game. Here\u2019s a quick benchmark of this model on Reasoning, Mathematics, and Science. This confirms that the model is not just suitable for coding but also for all your other needs. They claim it\u2019s an all-rounder. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f This is all cool, and I\u2019ll confirm the claim, but in this article, I will mainly be comparing the model on coding, and let\u2019s see how well it performs compared to Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Coding Problems Let\u2019s compare these two models in coding. We\u2019ll do a total of 4 tests, mainly on WebDev, animation and a tricky LeetCode question. 1. Flight Simulator Prompt: Create a simple flight simulator using JavaScript. The simulator should feature a basic plane that can take off from a flat runway. The plane\u2019s movement should be controlled with simple keyboard inputs (e.g., arrow keys or WASD). Additionally, it generates a basic cityscape using blocky structures, similar to Minecraft. Response from Gemini 2.5 Pro You can find the code it generated here: Link Here\u2019s the output of the program: I definitely got exactly what I asked for, with everything functioning, from plane movements to the basic Minecraft-styled block buildings. I can\u2019t really complain about anything here. 10/10 for this one. Response from Claude 3.7 Sonnet You can find the code it generated here: Link Here\u2019s the output of the program: I can see some issues with this one. The plane clearly faces sideways, and I don\u2019t know why. Again, it was out of control once it took off and went clearly outside the city. Basically, I\u2019d say we didn\u2019t really get a completely working flight simulator here. Summary: It\u2019s fair to say that Gemini 2.5 really got this correct in one shot. But the issues with the Claude 3.7 Sonnet code aren\u2019t really that big to resolve. Yeah, we didn\u2019t really get the output as expected, and it\u2019s definitely not close to what Gemini 2.5 Pro got us. 2. Rubik\u2019s Cube Solver This is one of the toughest questions for LLMs. I\u2019ve tried it with many other LLMs, but none could correct it. Let\u2019s see how these two models do this one. Prompt: Build a simple 3D Rubik\u2019s Cube visualizer and solver in JavaScript using Three.js. The cube should be a 3\u00d73 Rubik\u2019s Cube with standard colours. Have a scramble button that randomly scrambles the cube. Include a solve function that animates the solution step by step. Allow basic mouse controls to rotate the view. Response from Gemini 2.5 Pro You can find the code it generated here: Link Here\u2019s the output of the program: It\u2019s impressive that it could do something this hard in one shot. With the 1 million token context window, I can truly see how powerful this model seems to be. Response from Claude 3.7 Sonnet You can find the code it generated here: Link Here\u2019s the output of the program: Again, I was kind of disappointed that it had the same issue as some other LLMs: failing with the colours and completely failing to solve the cube. I did try to help it come up with the answer, but it didn\u2019t really help. Summary: Here again, Gemini 2.5 Pro takes the lead. And the best part is that all of it was done in one shot. Claude 3.7 was really disappointing, as it could not get this one correct, despite being one of the finest coding models out there. 3. Ball Bouncing Inside a Spinning 4D Tesseract Prompt: Create a simple JavaScript script that visualizes a ball bouncing inside a rotating 4D tesseract. When the ball collides with a side, highlight that side to indicate the impact. Response from Gemini 2.5 Pro You can find the code it generated here: Link Here\u2019s the output of the program: I cannot notice a single issue in the output. The ball and the collision physics all work perfectly, even the part where I asked it to highlight the collision side works. This free model seems to be insane for coding. \ud83d\udd25 Response from Claude 3.7 Sonnet You can find the code it generated here: Link Here\u2019s the output of the program: Wow, finally, Claude 3.7 Sonnet got an answer correct. It also added colors to each side, but who asked for it? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Nevertheless, I can\u2019t really complain much here, as the main functionality seems to work just fine. Summary: The answer is evident this time. Both models got the answer correct, implementing everything I asked for. I won\u2019t really say that I like the output of Claude 3.7 Sonnet more, but it definitely put in quite some work compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro. 4. LeetCode Problem For this one, let\u2019s do a quick LeetCode check with to see how these models handle solving a tricky LeetCode question with an acceptance rate of just 14.9%: Maximum Value Sum by Placing 3 Rooks. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is known to be super good at solving LC questions. If you want to see how Claude 3.7 compares to some top models like Grok 3 and o3-mini-high, check out this blog post: Claude 3.7 Sonnet vs. Grok 3 vs. o3-mini-high: Coding comparison Prompt: You are given a m x n 2D array board representing a chessboard, where board[i][j] represents the value of the cell (i, j). Rooks in the same row or column attack each other. You need to place three rooks on the chessboard such that the rooks do not attack each other. Return the maximum sum of the cell values on which the rooks are placed. Example 1: Input: board = [[-3,1,1,1],[-3,1,-3,1],[-3,2,1,1]] Output: 4 Explanation: We can place the rooks in the cells (0, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 1) for a sum of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. Example 2: Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] Output: 15 Explanation: We can place the rooks in the cells (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 2) for a sum of 1 + 5 + 9 = 15. Example 3: Input: board = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]] Output: 3 Explanation: We can place the rooks in the cells (0, 2), (1, 1), and (2, 0) for a sum of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Constraints: 3 <= m == board.length <= 100 3 <= n == board[i].length <= 100 -109 <= board[i][j] <= 109 Response from Gemini 2.5 Pro Given how easily it answered all three of the coding questions we tested, I have quite high hopes for this model. You can find the code it generated here: Link It did take quite some time to answer this one, though, and the code it wrote is kind of super complex to make sense of. I think it answered it more complicated than required. But still, the main thing we\u2019re looking for is to see if it can answer it correctly. As expected, it also answered this tough LeetCode question in one shot. This is one of the questions I got stuck on when learning DSA. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m happy it did. Response from Claude 3.7 Sonnet I hope this model will crush this one, as in all the other coding tests I\u2019ve done, Claude 3.7 Sonnet has answered all of the LeetCode questions correctly. You can find the code it generated here: Link It did write correct code but got TLE, but if I have to compare the code\u2019s simplicity, I\u2019d say this model made the code simpler and easier to understand. Summary: Gemini 2.5 got the answer correct and also wrote the code in the expected time complexity, but Claude 3.7 Sonnet fell into TLE. If I have to compare the code simplicity, Claude 3.7\u2019s generated code seems to be better. Conclusion For me, Gemini 2.5 Pro is the winner. We\u2019ve compared two models that are said to be the best at coding. The big difference I see in the model stats is just that Gemini 2.5 Pro has a slightly higher context window, but let\u2019s not forget that this is an experimental model, and improvements are still on the way. Imagine this model\u2019s performance after a 2M token context window. Google\u2019s been killing it recently with such solid models, previously with the Gemma 3 27B model, a super lightweight model with unbelievable results, and now with this beast of a model, Gemini 2.5 Pro.

The moment where this is tested at Oracle has arrived, as they have a serious cybersecurity incident playing out in a service they manage for customers. Back on March 21st, Bleeping Computer ran a story around a threat actor named rose87168 claiming to have breached some Oracle services inside *.oraclecloud.com Oracle told Bleeping Computer, and customers, \u201cThere has been no breach of Oracle Cloud. The published credentials are not for the Oracle Cloud. No Oracle Cloud customers experienced a breach or lost any data\u201d The threat actor then posted an archive.org URL and provided it to Bleeping Computer, strongly suggesting they had write access to login.us2.oraclecloud.com, a service using Oracle Access Manager. This server is entirely managed by Oracle: https://cyberplace.social/@GossiTheDog/114202395143978043 Oracle have since requested Archive.org take down the proof: The threat actor then provided a several hour long recording of an internal Oracle meeting, complete with Oracle employees talking for two hours: The meeting is viewable here and the transcript is here: https://github.com/j-klawson/oracle_breach_2025/blob/main/youtube_video_transcript.txt The two hour video includes things like accessing internal Oracle password vaults, and customer facing systems: I\u2019ve masked the root passwords of Oracle\u2019s systems Both Hudson Rock and Bleeping Computer were then able to confirm with Oracle customers that their data \u2014 including staff email addresses \u2014 was in data released by the threat actor: Oracle customers confirm data stolen in alleged cloud breach is valid Despite Oracle denying a breach of its Oracle Cloud federated SSO login servers and the theft of account data for 6\u2026 www.bleepingcomputer.com The threat actor, rose87168, is still active online and releasing data \u2014 and threatening to release more: They have also released data to cybersecurity threat intelligence providers. In data released to a journalist for validation, it has now become 100% clear to me that there has been cybersecurity incident at Oracle, involving systems which processed customer data. For example, the threat actor has publicly provided complete Oracle configuration files \u2014 current, too. As one example, they have provided Oracle webserver configuration files: All the systems impacted are directly managed by Oracle. Some of the data provided to journalists is current, too. This is a serious cybersecurity incident which impacts customers, in a platform managed by Oracle. Oracle are attempting to wordsmith statements around Oracle Cloud and use very specific words to avoid responsibility. This is not okay. Oracle need to clearly, openly and publicly communicate what happened, how it impacts customers, and what they\u2019re doing about it. This is a matter of trust and responsibility. Step up, Oracle \u2014 or customers should start stepping off. Update 1 \u2014 Oracle rebadged old Oracle Cloud services to be Oracle Classic. Oracle Classic has the security incident. Oracle are denying it on \u201cOracle Cloud\u201d by using this scope \u2014 but it\u2019s still Oracle cloud services that Oracle manage. That\u2019s part of the wordplay. Update 2 \u2014 although Oracle used the archive.org exclusion process to remove evidence of writing to one of the Oraclecloud.com webservers, they forgot to remove the 2nd URL (click picture for hyperlink).
