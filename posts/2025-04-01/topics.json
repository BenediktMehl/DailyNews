This has already happened in several European countries, as part of the international Art of Coding initiative to make the demoscene a global UNESCO heritage. I think this makes plenty of sense, since the demoscene is arguably the oldest creative digital subculture around. It has largely stuck to its own values and traditions throughout the world\u2019s technological and economical shifts, and that sort of consistency is quite unusual in the digital world. The main idea of the demoscene is to compete with productions that maximize a certain hardware, but that\u2019s not what all demosceners like to do. My demogroup Hack n\u2019 Trade for example, cares more about making weird stuff, and there are plenty of other groups like that. Some demosceners don\u2019t release anything at all, but might do important work to keep the scene alive (BBS-trading, organizing parties, preserving software\u2026). I\u2019ve written plenty of papers and blog posts about the demoscene, and I\u2019ve often felt a gap between the stuff I write as a researcher and my personal experience of the demoscene. There is certainly an international demoscene with big events and huge releases that can be described in general terms, but what has mattered more to me is the local scenes, the small parties and the people you hang out with. Meeting up with a bunch of friends and making weird computer stuff \u201cfor no reason, really\u201d is a great setting. That\u2019s what I enjoy the most, in the end. For other sceners, it\u2019s different. There is a sort of diversity in the scene that is difficult to capture and generalize. The Swedish coder with a well-paid programming job and a busy family life might consider the demoscene as an escape to his teenage years, while the LSD-munching raver from France who trades illegal warez on BBSs and makes weird pixel art considers the scene as a free culture without corporate or art world bullshit. There\u2019s room for both in the scene, because it is werdly conservative and open at the same time. And perhaps that is one of the reasons why it should be considered an intangible heritage.",

For many outlets, this is still the case, particularly those publishing super-secretive group chats of powerful government officials who seem eager to trample on the rights of the press. But for others, like the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, both of which have seen their benefactors bend a knee to Donald Trump and sacrifice the integrity of their newspapers in the process, ownership has become a problem. A problem that the Guardian US, the American arm of the British newspaper, has exploited. \u201cAll around us, media organizations have begun to capitulate,\u201d editor Betsy Reed writes in the current fundraising appeal at the bottom of each Guardian article. \u201cThe Guardian has neither a self-interested billionaire owner nor profit-seeking corporate henchmen pressuring us to appease the rich and powerful. With the new administration boasting about its desire to punish journalists, and Trump and his allies already pursuing lawsuits against newspapers whose stories they don\u2019t like, it has never been more urgent, or more perilous, to pursue fair, accurate reporting. Can you support The Guardian today?\u201d The asks themselves are not new. The Guardian for the past eight years has asked readers to donate in support of its journalism, a \u201creader revenue\u201d program that helps the paper exist without a paywall. But the appeals have gotten more strident \u2014 and more Trump-focused \u2014 since the Post and the L.A. Times withdrew expected endorsements for Kamala Harris last fall, and to great effect. The last week in February was the second-biggest week in U.S. reader-revenue history for The Guardian; the biggest was the week of the 2024 presidential election. The Guardian US expects to hit $44 million in voluntary reader donations in the U.S. and Canada this year, up 33 percent over last year, with some people supporting on a recurring basis and others giving one-time contributions. A first-person account by a Canadian citizen detained by ICE, for example, netted $105,000 in pledged donations. These contributions account for more than 60 percent of the American operation\u2019s total revenue, which last year exceeded costs by $16 million (the rest of its revenue comes from advertising and philanthropic support from foundations). The amount that people are contributing on a pledged basis doubled in October \u2014 the month that Jeff Bezos pulled the Post\u2019s endorsement for Harris \u2014 and has stayed at that level every month since, according to internal data provided by The Guardian, which just surpassed 350,000 recurring supporters in the U.S. \u201cOur messaging does appeal to people to support our work as a kind of cause, and I think that works for a number of reasons,\u201d Reed said in a recent interview in her downtown office, \u201cbut one is that there is a real crisis of access to reliable information for people who don\u2019t want or have the means to subscribe to the New York Times. That is a real problem that we have an answer to.\u201d Guardian managing director Steve Sachs added that The Guardian\u2019s global perspective \u2014 the internal catchphrase of the U.S. operation is that it covers America for the world and the world for America \u2014 is also a draw at such a volatile moment in geopolitics. \u201cPeople are even more interested now than they were six months ago,\u201d he said. The Guardian US\u2019 audience is split 50-50 between American and global readers. The Guardian launched its U.S. operation more than a decade ago and seemed to have a promising start, hiring high-profile columnists like Michael Wolff and Glenn Greenwald and winning a Pulitzer for reporting on widespread secret surveillance by the National Security Agency. But as the Obama era gave way to the Trump era, the close association of the Guardian US with surveillance-state reporting made it less relevant to American readers. Annual losses led to restructuring that hit the U.S. operation, once housed in an airy Soho loft, particularly hard. But during the pandemic, the Guardian US, like other news outlets, experienced a surge in reader interest, readying it for an expansion in 2022 that included hiring Reed, formerly of The Nation and the Intercept, and Sachs, who\u2019d spent years on the business side of Time Inc. The audience has continued to grow, with Sachs noting that the site typically sees between 40 million to 50 million unique visitors a month. \u201cWe\u2019re now at a place where our audience is actually bigger in the U.S. than The Wall Street Journal\u2019s audience in the U.S.,\u201d he said. Leaders and organizations across the media industry have been trying to innovate in the way people can pay for news. Sachs says he\u2019s been increasingly asked about the no-paywall model, with others in the industry wondering whether they should adopt the same. \u201cIf you\u2019re creative enough, you can figure out some new things,\u201d he tells people. \u201cBut the question is, does it scale?\u201d If it\u2019s \u201canother half-million dollars, a million dollars, whatever, it\u2019s not worth the effort,\u201d he said. Other publications that were donations-focused, including Vox.com (which is owned by the same parent company as New York), have moved away to membership models as a result. \u201cThe reason I think that it works for us is we cover so much breaking news and it drives a lot of traffic, and we have the scale to make it work,\u201d Reed said. \u201cEven if we only monetize one percent, it\u2019s still a lot.\u201d Still, even scaled-up publications like the Guardian US have to contend with the fact that donations are very boom-and-bust. Despite The Guardian\u2019s strident anti-Trump fundraising pushes, its broader audience is less partisan, as is the tone of its news coverage. It\u2019s a weird line to straddle. \u201cThe appeals that you see at the bottom of articles are really framed around issues of press freedom and our identity and our structure of ownership,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThey are not appeals that say, \u2018Trump is bad, you need to support The Guardian, we are against Trump.\u2019\u201d Maybe not explicitly. But they are clearly benefitting from this moment and using the new money to hire, with expectations to continue growing its staff in the U.S. this year. The big question is: Will it last? \u201cI mean, unfortunately, there\u2019s no shortage of global crises going on, from what\u2019s happening in the Middle East to Ukraine to what\u2019s happening in this country,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThe world is incredibly interested in the shitshow here. God, it\u2019s like they\u2019re rubbernecking at a car crash.\u201d SIGN UP FOR THE INTELLIGENCER NEWSLETTER Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

Hide Get inspired Blog Docs New in Chrome / Sign in Blog On this page Meet appearance: base-select A <select> can now include rich HTML content Completely customizable Unchanged JavaScript interfaces Resources Chrome for Developers Blog Was this helpful? The <select> element can now be customized with CSS bookmark_border Adam Argyle Published: March 24, 2025 From Chrome 135, web developers and designers can finally unite on an accessible, standardized and CSS styleable <select> element on the web. This has been many years in the making, many hours of engineering and collaborative specification work, and the result is an incredibly rich and powerful component that won't break in older browsers. Here's a video of customized selects using these new features: Featuring demos by Una, Brecht, and Adam. If you've been following along closely, you'll notice a few spec names and features have changed since Una's request for community feedback. Luckily, if you worked from that post and are interested in what's changed, Una's also got you covered. There's also shiny new documentation on MDN for customizable select, packed with details. Meet appearance: base-select A new CSS property appearance: base-select that puts the <select> element into a new, configurable and styleable state to be commonly referred to as \"base\" styles: .custom-select { &, &::picker(select) { appearance: base-select; } } Using base-select unlocks a number of new features and behaviors: Changes the browsers HTML parser for the contents inside the <select>. Changes the rendered internals of the <select>. Exposes new internal parts and states for the <select>. A new minimal look, optimized for customization. Shown options are in the top-layer, like a popover. Shown options positioned with anchor(). Using base-select loses a number of features and behaviors: The <select> doesn't render outside the browser pane. It doesn't trigger built-in mobile operating system components. The <select> stops taking the width of the longest <option>. Expect more \"base\" appearances for other elements to develop over time! A <select> can now include rich HTML content Before you could customize a <select>, if you put things like an image or SVG into the <option> element, the browser would ignore them. Consider the following HTML, the browser would read it as you authored it: <select class=\"custom-select\"> <option> <svg aria-hidden>\u2026</svg> <span>HTML</span> </option> <option> <svg aria-hidden>\u2026</svg> <span>CSS</span> </option> <option> <svg aria-hidden>\u2026</svg> <span>JavaScript</span> </option> <option> <svg aria-hidden>\u2026</svg> <span>WASM</span> </option> </select> However the used DOM wouldn't include the <svg>: <select class=\"custom-select\"> <option> <span>HTML</span> </option> <option> <span>CSS</span> </option> <option> <span>JavaScript</span> </option> <option> <span>WASM</span> </option> </select> Here's (from left to right) Chrome, Safari, and Firefox rendering the preceding HTML. If the browser supports appearance: base-select then the SVG will appear in the option, otherwise it won't. Try it in this Codepen. There's risk in breaking existing websites with customizable select, due to the parser changes. Chrome has the features behind a Finch experiment in case there is an emergency need to turn it off. If things go well, the experiment will end and the code will be shipped permanently into the source. Completely customizable Every part of a base-select can be swapped out, customized and animated. Here's a demo that uses every new feature to create recognizable and meaningful select experiences. Try it in this Codepen. Find many more examples in the resources section at the end of this post. Unchanged JavaScript interfaces There's no risks to your existing JavaScript interactions with a <select> element. However, if you do begin adding rich HTML into your <option> elements, you should test the selected values, as the browser does still parse and ignore images and SVG. The logic has changed though, for determining the selected content string, and depending on what you have in your options, you may need to make adjustments. If you're using the value attribute on an <option> you have nothing to worry about. Resources Chrome is first to implement base-select, but every browser participated in the specifications, and there's more \"base\" elements yet to be completed. This is just a start. Stay tuned as we'll be continuing to add guidance, examples and resources on customizing select elements. Until then, checkout the following links for more information.
