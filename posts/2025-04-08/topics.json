While kids in most parts of Japan are obsessed with Pok\u00e9mon cards \u2014 or perhaps the franchise\u2019s latest smartphone game, Pok\u00e9mon TCG Pocket \u2014 the children of Kawara are clutching to something a little closer to home. They are playing a trading card game (TCG) where the stars aren\u2019t fantasy creatures, anime heroes or even famous baseball players, but ojisan (middle-aged or older men) from the local community of Saidosho. LIST OF CONTENTS: A CARD GAME WITH A LOCAL TWIST FROM COLLECTING TO BATTLING RELATED POSTS IMAGE: MAYUKO ICHII | EDITS BY TW A Card Game With a Local Twist On the surface, this Ojisan TCG looks like any other collectible card game. As of March 18, there are 47 different cards in the collection, including 28 featuring local men with stats and special abilities. Take the Firewall card, for example. It features Mr. Honda (74), a former fire brigade chief who helped keep the town safe for decades. Then there\u2019s Soba Master Mr. Takeshita (81), who runs a local soba noodle-making class and now holds legendary status among the town\u2019s youth. The most popular of them all is probably All-Rounder Mr. Fujii (68), a former prison officer turned community volunteer. His card is so sought after that local kids have even started asking him for autographs. \u201cI was honestly shocked when they asked me to sign it,\u201d Mr. Fujii said, laughing. \u201cI never imagined I\u2019d become a trading card, let alone have fans.\u201d Each card comes with different attacks and an assigned elemental type \u2014 just like a classic fantasy card game \u2014 but with a humorous, real-world edge. For instance, Firewall is, unsurprisingly, a fire type, equipped with a Super Guard move, which deals a hefty 200 damage. A card called Plasma Conductor, featuring a smiling, bespectacled ojisan juxtaposed with an image of a lightbulb, is an electric type. At the bottom of the card, there is a line of text explaining how he can fix any electrical appliance without fail. SCREENSHOT TAKEN FROM FNN PRIME ONLINE From Collecting to Battling The creator of the game is Eri Miyahara, the Secretary General of the Saidosho Community Council. \u201cWe wanted to strengthen the connection between the children and the older generations in the community. There are so many amazing people here. I thought it was such a shame that no one knew about them,\u201d she said in an interview with Fuji News Network (FNN). \u201cSince the card game went viral, so many kids are starting to look up to these men as heroic figures.\u201d The plan worked. Kids have started attending local events and volunteering for community activities \u2014 just for a chance to meet the ojisan from their cards. Participation in town events has reportedly doubled since the game launched. Interestingly, Ojisan TCG didn\u2019t start as a competitive game. The first set of cards was designed purely for collecting, but the local children quickly turned it into something more dynamic. They began comparing stats and declaring, \u201cMy card is stronger than yours.\u201d Seeing this, the game\u2019s creator decided to take it to the next level. New rules were introduced, allowing the cards to be used in actual battles. The objective isn\u2019t to defeat the opponent\u2019s card but to outplay it based on the characters\u2019 skills and abilities. The rarity of a card isn\u2019t based on fantasy stats \u2014 it\u2019s tied to real-world contributions. The more actively the ojisan engages in volunteer work or community service, the higher the chances of their card being upgraded to a shiny version with a glossy laminated effect. While the cards \u2014 all made entirely by hand \u2014 are currently in high demand and often out of stock, they are only available for sale at the Saidosho Community Center. A pack of three cards costs \u00a5100, while a pack of six cards \u2014 including a shiny card \u2014 costs \u00a5500. Despite the limited supply, demand remains high, with many kids saving their pocket money for a chance to score a shiny version of their favorite ojisan.

        "url": "https://mrcjkb.dev/posts/2025-04-07-lux-announcement.html",
        "content": "mrcjkb.dev HOME ABOUT CONTACT CV ARCHIVE Announcing Lux - a luxurious package manager for Lua Posted on April 7, 2025 It\u2019s time Lua got the ecosystem it deserves! For a bit over a year, we have been cooking up Lux, a new package manager for creating, maintaining and publishing Lua code. It does this through a simple and intuitive CLI inspired by other well-known package managers like cargo. Today, we feel the project has hit a state of \u201cvery usable for everyday tasks\u201d1. Features Fully portable between systems. Parallel builds and installs. \ud83d\ude80 Handles the installation of Lua headers2 for you. Forget about users complaining they have the wrong Lua headers installed on their system. All you need to do is specify compatible lua versions. A fully embeddable lux-lib crate, which can even be built to expose a Lua API. Has an actual notion of a \u201cproject\u201d, with a simple governing lux.toml file. Uses the lux.toml to auto-generate rockspecs. Say goodbye to managing 10 different rockspec files in your repository. \ud83c\udf89 Powerful lockfile support. Fully reproducible builds and developer environments. Source + rockspec hashes that can be used to make Lux easy to integrate with Nix. Integrated code formatting (lx fmt) and linting (lx check) powered by stylua and luacheck. Native support for running tests with busted. Including the ability to use Neovim as a Lua interpreter. Sets up a pure environment. Compatible with the luarocks ecosystem. In case you have a complex rockspec that you don\u2019t want to rewrite to TOML, lux allows you to create an extra.rockspec file, so everything just works. Need to install a package that uses a custom luarocks build backend? Lux can install luarocks and shell out to it for the build step, while managing dependencies natively. Motivation Lua While extensive, Luarocks carries with it around 20 years of baggage, which makes it difficult to make suitable for modern Lua development, while retaining backward compatibility. With Lux, we\u2019re pushing for a fresh start: A notion of a project: With TOML as the main manifest format, you can easily add, remove, pin and update dependencies using the CLI. If you\u2019re in a project directory (with a lux.toml), commands like build will build your project, and install it into a project-local tree. Building will produce a lockfile of your project\u2019s dependencies, allowing you to reproduce your exact dependencies on any compatible system. Enforced SemVer: Luarocks allows for arbitrary versions after the patch version. For example, 1.0.1.0.0.0.2 is considered valid by Luarocks, but it has no useful meaning. Lux will parse this too, but will treat everything after the patch version as a prerelease version. We made this decision because we want to encourage package maintainers to stick to SemVer for their releases. Parallel builds: Inspired by the Nix store, Lux hashes3 install directories to prevent package conflicts and enable highly parallel builds without risking file system corruption. Neovim Thanks to our Neovim plugin manager, rocks.nvim, and the later addition of Luarocks support to lazy.nvim, Luarocks has been steadily gaining popularity in the Neovim space as a way of distributing plugins. But it\u2019s been heavily held back by not being fully portable and by being unpredictable from system to system. Because Luarocks is written in Lua, installing a large number of packages and synchronising plugins with rocks.nvim has been painfully slow. With Lux, we hope that plugins will start treating themselves as Lua projects. Using Lux is non-destructive and doesn\u2019t interfere with the current way of distributing Neovim plugins (which is via git). In fact, Lux has a --nvim flag, which tells it to install packages into a tree structure that is compatible with Neovim\u2019s :h packages. Nix If a Neovim plugin exists as a Luarocks package, nixpkgs will use it as the source of truth. This is mainly because with a proper package manager, the responsibility of declaring dependencies is the responsibility of the package author. However, Luarocks has very basic lockfile support, which does not include source hashes. While Luarocks (as does Lux) supports conflicting dependencies via its luarocks.loader, nixpkgs cannot reasonably add multiple versions of the same dependency to its package set. Lux\u2019s lux.lock, stores source and rockspec hashes of each dependency. If the source URL is a git repository, lux will store a NAR hash. This means the a lux.lock can be used to create a fixed-output derivation with all dependencies, just as you can do with a Cargo.lock. Next steps Right now, our priorities are set on squashing bugs and improving error messages. Soon, we\u2019ll be rewriting rocks.nvim to use Lux instead of Luarocks under the hood. This should let rocks.nvim catch up with other plugin managers in terms of speed and make it endlessly more stable than before. If the rewrite is successful, then that spells great news for the Neovim ecosystem going forward, as it means that Lux can be embedded in other places too (e.g. lazy.nvim, which has had troubles with luarocks in the past)!
