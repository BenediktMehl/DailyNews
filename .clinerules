# Cline Project Rules

## Clean Coding Guidelines
- Write clear and concise code with meaningful variable and function names.
- Follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables and functions).
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Never use comments to explain code; instead, refactor the code to be self-explanatory.
- Use descriptive commit messages to explain changes made to the codebase.
- Avoid code duplication by using functions and modules.
- Regularly refactor code to improve readability and performance.
