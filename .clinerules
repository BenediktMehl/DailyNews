# Cline Project Rules

## Clean Coding Guidelines
- Write clear and concise code with meaningful variable and function names.
- Follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables and functions).
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Never use comments to explain code; instead, refactor the code to be self-explanatory.
- Use descriptive commit messages to explain changes made to the codebase.
- Avoid code duplication by using functions and modules.
- Regularly refactor code to improve readability and performance.

## Python Execution Guidelines
- Before executing any Python scripts, activate the virtual environment using `source bin/activate`. This only needs to be done once before the first command.
- Before implementing a new library, check if it's already installed. If not, install it. Also, check if there are existing libraries that could be used instead of the new library.
- Use `python3` and `pip3` for Python script execution and package installation.
